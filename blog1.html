        Hey everyone! I'm Adithya, a freshman in CSE at IIIT Hyderabad. Ever since I got my hands on a computer, I've been hooked, and now I'm here, living my dream. IIIT Hyderabad is amazing, with cool tech stuff everywhere and really smart people all around. My first day was a mix of being super excited and a bit overwhelmed.
        The courses are tough but super interesting. I'm learning a lot about coding and how to solve tricky problems. I even got to make my own app, which was awesome. Besides studying, there's so much to do here. I joined the coding club, have been to a few hackathons, and even found people who love music as much as I do.
        Balancing classes, coding, and hobbies is hard, but it's teaching me a lot about managing my time and not giving up when things get tough. I'm looking forward to learning more cool stuff, especially about AI and machine learning, and making the most out of my time here. Can't wait to see what's next!
